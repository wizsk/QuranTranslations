1: When the earth is shaken ˹in˺ its ultimate quaking,
2: and when the earth throws out ˹all˺ its contents,[1]
	[1] lit., burdens (i.e., treasures and dead bodies). 
3: and humanity cries, “What is wrong with it?”—
4: on that Day the earth will recount everything,
5: having been inspired by your Lord ˹to do so˺.
6: On that Day people will proceed in separate groups[1] to be shown ˹the consequences of˺ their deeds.
	[1] The believers will head to Paradise and the disbelievers will head to Hell.
7: So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it.
8: And whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it.
