1: A challenger[1] has demanded a punishment bound to come
	[1] According to <a href=\"/8:32\">8:32</a>, An-Naḍr ibn Al-Ḥârith challenged Allah, saying, “If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones upon us from the sky or overcome us with a painful punishment.”
2: for the disbelievers—to be averted by none—
3: from Allah, Lord of pathways of ˹heavenly˺ ascent,
4: ˹through which˺ the angels and the ˹holy˺ spirit[1] will ascend to Him on a Day fifty thousand years in length.[2]
	[1] The holy spirit is the angel Gabriel. 
	[2] Judgment Day will seem like 50 000 years for a disbeliever, but it will seem like a very short period for a believer. The Prophet (ﷺ) is reported in a ḥadîth collected by Imâm Aḥmed to have said that, for the believer, this long period will be like the time they took to perform a single prayer in the world.
5: So endure ˹this denial, O  Prophet,˺ with beautiful patience.
6: They truly see this ˹Day˺ as impossible,
7: but We see it as inevitable.
8: On that Day the sky will be like molten brass
9: and the mountains like ˹tufts of˺ wool.
10: And no close friend will ask ˹about˺ their friends,
11: ˹although˺ they will be made to see each other. The wicked will wish to ransom themselves from the punishment of that Day by their children,
12: their spouses, their siblings,
13: their clan that sheltered them,
14: and everyone on earth altogether, just to save themselves.
15: But no! There will certainly be a raging Flame
16: ripping off scalps.
17: It will summon whoever turned their backs ˹on Allah˺ and turned away ˹from the truth˺,
18: and gathered and hoarded ˹wealth˺.
19: Indeed, humankind was created impatient
20: distressed when touched with evil,
21: and withholding when touched with good—
22: except those who pray,
23: consistently performing their prayers;
24: and who give the rightful share of their wealth
25: to the beggar and the poor;
26: and who ˹firmly˺ believe in the Day of Judgment;
27: and those who fear the punishment of their Lord—
28: ˹knowing that˺ none should feel secure from their Lord’s punishment—
29: and those who guard their chastity[1]
	[1] lit., private parts. 
30: except with their wives or those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession,[1] for then they are free from blame,
	[1] See footnote for <a href=\"/4:3\">4:3</a>. 
31: but whoever seeks beyond that are the transgressors.
32: ˹The faithful are˺ also those who are true to their trusts and covenants;
33: and who are honest in their testimony;
34: and who are ˹properly˺ observant of their prayers.
35: These will be in Gardens, held in honour.
36: So what is the matter with the disbelievers that they rush ˹head-long˺ towards you ˹O Prophet˺,
37: from the right and the left, in groups ˹to mock you˺?[1]
	[1] Some Meccan pagans used to gather around the Prophet (ﷺ) to mock him and the believers, saying that if there is in fact a Hereafter, they are better entitled to Paradise than the poor believers. 
38: Does every one of them expect to be admitted into a Garden of Bliss?
39: But no! Indeed, they ˹already˺ know what We created them from.[1]
	[1] i.e., from a humble fluid. See <a href=\"/32:8\">32:8</a>. 
40: So, I do swear by the Lord of ˹all˺ the points of sunrise and sunset[1] that We are truly capable
	[1] The daily points of sunrise and sunset, caused by the earth’s rotation around its own axis. 
41: of replacing them with ˹others˺ better than them, and We cannot be prevented ˹from doing so˺.
42: So let them indulge ˹in falsehood˺ and amuse ˹themselves˺ until they face their Day, which they have been threatened with—
43: the Day they will come forth from the graves swiftly, as if racing to an idol ˹for a blessing˺,[1]
	[1] Or “… as if rushing towards a target.”
44: with eyes downcast, utterly covered with disgrace. That is the Day they have ˹always˺ been warned of.
