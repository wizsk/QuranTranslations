1: Woe to every backbiter, slanderer,
2: who amasses wealth ˹greedily˺ and counts it ˹repeatedly˺,
3: thinking that their wealth will make them immortal!
4: Not at all! Such a person will certainly be tossed into the Crusher.
5: And what will make you realize what the Crusher is?
6: ˹It is˺ Allah’s kindled Fire,
7: which rages over the hearts.
8: It will be sealed over them,
9: ˹tightly secured˺ with long braces.[1] 
	[1] Other possible translations: 1. “The Fire will be in towering columns.” 2. “They will be tied to long pillars.”
