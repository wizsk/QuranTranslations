1: When the sun is put out,
2: and when the stars fall down,
3: and when the mountains are blown away,
4: and when pregnant camels are left untended,[1]
	[1] Ten-month pregnant camels were the most precious thing for nomadic Arabs. These camels were always cared for and treasured. 
5: and when wild beasts are gathered together,[1]
	[1] All animals will be brought together for judgment and then they will be reduced to dust. 
6: and when the seas are set on fire,[1]
	[1] On the Day of Judgment the oceans and seas will be on fire.
7: and when the souls ˹and their bodies˺ are paired ˹once more˺,
8: and when baby girls, buried alive, are asked
9: for what crime they were put to death,[1]
	[1] Some pagan Arabs used to bury their infant daughters alive for fear of shame or poverty. This practice was condemned and abolished by Islam. See <a href=\"/16:58-59\">16:58-59</a>
10: and when the records ˹of deeds˺ are laid open,
11: and when the sky is stripped away,
12: and when the Hellfire is fiercely flared up,
13: and when Paradise is brought near—
14: ˹on that Day˺ each soul will know what ˹deeds˺ it has brought along.
15: I do swear by the receding stars
16: which travel and hide,[1]
	[1] This probably refers to black holes. Kanasa means to sweep or hide. Miknasah is derived from this, and is the standard word for a vacuum cleaner. 
17: and the night as it falls
18: and the day as it breaks![1]
	[1] lit., the day as it takes its first breath. 
19: Indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is the Word of ˹Allah delivered by Gabriel,˺ a noble messenger-angel,
20: full of power, held in honour by the Lord of the Throne,
21: obeyed there ˹in heaven˺, and trustworthy.
22: And your fellow man[1] is not insane.
	[1] i.e., Muḥammad (ﷺ).
23: And he did see that ˹angel˺ on the clear horizon,[1]
	[1] This is first time the Prophet (ﷺ) saw Gabriel in his angelic form. He saw him a second time in heaven during the Night Journey. See <a href=\"/53:5-15\">53:5-15</a>
24: and he does not withhold ˹what is revealed to him of˺ the unseen.
25: And this ˹Quran˺ is not the word of an outcast devil.[1]
	[1] See <a href=\"/26:210-212\">26:210-212</a>. 
26: So what ˹other˺ path would you take?
27: Surely this ˹Quran˺ is only a reminder to the whole world—
28: to whoever of you wills to take the Straight Way.
29: But you cannot will ˹to do so˺, except by the Will of Allah, the Lord of all worlds.
