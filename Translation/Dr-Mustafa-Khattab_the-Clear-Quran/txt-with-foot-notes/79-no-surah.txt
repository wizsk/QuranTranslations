1: By those ˹angels˺ stripping out ˹evil souls˺ harshly,
2: and those pulling out ˹good souls˺ gently,
3: and those gliding ˹through heavens˺ swiftly,
4: and those taking the lead vigorously,
5: and those conducting affairs ˹obediently˺!
6: ˹Consider˺ the Day ˹when˺ the quaking Blast will come to pass,[1]
	[1] The first Blast will cause everyone to die except those spared by Allah. Then the second one will cause the dead to come to life for judgment. See <a href=\"/39:68\">39:68</a>. 
7: followed by a second Blast.
8: ˹The deniers’˺ hearts on that Day will be trembling ˹in horror˺,
9: with their eyes downcast.
10: ˹But now˺ they ask ˹mockingly˺, “Will we really be restored to our former state,
11: even after we have been reduced to decayed bones?”
12: Adding, “Then such a return would be a ˹total˺ loss ˹for us˺!”
13: But indeed, it will take only one ˹mighty˺ Blast,
14: and at once they will be above ground.
15: Has the story of Moses reached you ˹O Prophet˺?
16: His Lord called him in the sacred valley of Ṭuwa,
17: ˹commanding,˺ “Go to Pharaoh, for he has truly transgressed ˹all bounds˺.
18: And say, ‘Would you ˹be willing to˺ purify yourself,
19: and let me guide you to your Lord so that you will be in awe ˹of Him˺?’”
20: Then Moses showed him the great sign,[1]
	[1] The staff turning into a snake. See <a href=\"/20:17-23\">20:17-23</a>
21: but he denied and disobeyed ˹Allah˺,
22: then turned his back, striving ˹against the truth˺.
23: Then he summoned ˹his people˺ and called out,
24: saying, “I am your lord, the most high!”
25: So Allah overtook him, making him an example in this life and the next.
26: Surely in this is a lesson for whoever stands in awe of ˹Allah˺.
27: Which is harder to create
28: raising it high and forming it flawlessly.
29: He dimmed its night, and brought forth its daylight.
30: As for the earth, He spread it out as well,[1]
	[1] The Arabic verb daḥa also suggests that the earth is egg-shaped. The noun form diḥya is still used in some Arab dialects to mean an egg. Based on <a href=\"/2:29\">2:29</a>, <a href=\"/41:9-12\">41:9-12</a>, and <a href=\"/79:27-33\">79:27-33</a>, Allah ordained both realms, then formed the earth and created its provisions, then formed the heaven into seven heavens—all in six ˹heavenly˺ Days. See footnote for <a href=\"/7:54\">7:54</a>.
31: bringing forth its water and pastures
32: and setting the mountains firmly ˹upon it˺—
33: all as ˹a means of˺ sustenance for you and your animals.
34: But, when the Supreme Disaster[1] comes to pass—
	[1] This is the second Blast which will cause the dead to come to life for judgment. See <a href=\"/39:68\">39:68</a>.
35: the Day every person will remember all ˹their˺ striving,
36: and the Hellfire will be displayed for all to see—
37: then as for those who transgressed
38: and preferred the ˹fleeting˺ life of this world,
39: the Hellfire will certainly be ˹their˺ home.
40: And as for those who were in awe of standing before their Lord and restrained themselves from ˹evil˺ desires,
41: Paradise will certainly be ˹their˺ home.
42: They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the Hour, “When will it be?”
43: But it is not for you to tell its time.[1]
	[1] Another possible translation: “What is this question? You ˹O Prophet˺ are one of its signs.” It is believed—based on authentic narrations from the Prophet—that he (ﷺ) is one of the signs of the Day of Judgment. 
44: That knowledge rests with your Lord ˹alone˺.
45: Your duty is only to warn whoever is in awe of it.
46: On the Day they see it, it will be as if they had stayed ˹in the world˺ no more than one evening or its morning.
